dbus
----

dbus is a simple library that implements native Go client bindings for the
D-Bus message bus system.

### Features

* Complete native implementation of the D-Bus message protocol
* Go-like API (channels for signals / asynchronous method calls, Goroutine-safe connections)
* Subpackages that help with the introspection / property interfaces

### Usage

The complete package documentation and some simple examples are available at
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/godbus/dbus/v5). Also, the
[\_examples](https://github.com/godbus/dbus/tree/master/_examples) directory
gives a short overview over the basic usage.

#### Projects using godbus
- [bluetooth](https://github.com/tinygo-org/bluetooth): cross-platform Bluetooth API for Go and TinyGo.
- [fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne): a cross platform GUI in Go inspired by Material Design.
- [fynedesk](https://github.com/fyne-io/fynedesk): a full desktop environment for Linux/Unix using Fyne.
- [go-systemd](https://github.com/coreos/go-systemd): Go bindings to systemd.
- [notify](https://github.com/esiqveland/notify) provides desktop notifications over dbus into a library.

Please note that the API is considered unstable for now and may change without
